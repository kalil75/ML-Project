Build a classifier to categorize webpages as evergreen or non-evergreen


 pages can either be classified as "ephemeral" or "evergreen". The ratings we get from our community give us strong signals that a page may no longer be relevant - but what if we could make this distinction ahead of time? A high quality prediction of "ephemeral" or "evergreen" would greatly improve a recommendation system like ours.
 
 
 Many people know evergreen content when they see it, but can an algorithm make the same determination without human intuition? Your mission is to build a classifier which will evaluate a large set of URLs and label them as either evergreen or ephemeral.
